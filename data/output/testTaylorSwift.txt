Gavilla: There, as the gods would have it, I fell in love with
Tarentius's wife; he kept an eating-house. Ye all knew Melissa
Tarentina, a pretty little punching-block, and withal beautiful; but
(so help me Hercules) I minded her not so much for the matter of the
Point of that, as that she was good-humour'd; if I asked her any
Thing, she never deny'd me; and what money I had, I trusted her with
It; nor did she ever fail me when I'd occasion. It so happened, that
A she-companion of hers had dy'd in the country, and she was gone
Thither; how to come at her I could not tell; but a friend is seen at
A dead lift; it also happened my master was gone to Capua to dispatch
Somewhat or other: I laid hold of the opportunity, and persuaded mine
Host to take an evenings walk of four or five miles out of town, for
He was a stout fellow, and as bold as a devil: The moon shone as
Bright as day, and about cock-crowing we fell in with a burying-place
And certain monument of the dead: my man loitered behind me
A-star-gazing, and I sitting expecting him, fell a singing and
Numbering them; when looking round me, what should I see but mine host
Stript stark-naked, and his cloaths lying by the high-wayside. The
Sight struck me every where, and I stood as if I had been dead; but he
Piss'd round his cloaths, and of a sudden was turned to a wolf: Don't
Think I jest; I value no man's estate at that rate, as to tell a lye
But as I was saying, after he was turned to a wolf, he set up a howl
And fled to the woods. At first I knew not where I was, till going to
Take up his cloaths, I found them also turn'd to stone. Another man
Would have dy'd for fear, but I drew my sword, and slaying all the
Ghosts that came in my way, lighted at last on the place where my
Mistress was: I entered the first door; my eyes were sunk in my head
The sweat ran off me by more streams than one, and I was just
Breathing my last, without thought of recovery; when my Melissa coming
Up to me, began to wonder why I'd be walking so late; and 'if,' said
She, 'you had come a little sooner, you might have done us a kindness;
For a wolf came into the farm, and has made butchers work enough among
The cattle; but tho' he got off, he has no reason to laugh, for a
Servant of ours ran him through the neck with a pitchfork.' As soon as
I heard her, I could not hold open my eyes any longer, and ran home by
Daylight, like a vintner whose house had been robb'd: But coming by
The place where the cloaths were turned to stone, I saw nothing but a
Puddle of blood; and when I got home, found mine host lying a-bed like
An oxe in his stall, and a chirurgeon dressing his neck. I understood
Afterwards he was a fellow that could change his skin; but from that
Day forward, could never eat a bit of bread with him, no, if you'd
Have kill'd me. Let them that don't believe me, examine the truth of
It; may your good angels plague me as I tell ye a lye. And when I meet the band When I want the penthouse of your heart You should've been here And his mistress moved in Like snow on the beach This pain wouldn't be for evermore Or Stevie's songs, wondrous CD roms [Verse 3] To be certain, we'll be tall again 215 | Grateful Dead | American Beauty | 1970 Don't you (Ah, ah, ah)11Embed I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers You'll be mine and I'll be yours [Outro] Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause We are never, ever, ever getting back together And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face And all I have is your sympathy Run from it all You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you Forever and ever, ah Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys While we were grave, and other while merry And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before My ex-man brought his new girlfriend [Chorus] Mm, mm And there is happiness I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight Between us, it was bitter At the restaurant when I was still the one you want And now I see, now I see Oh, oh-oh (A tale as old as time) Carolina stains on the dress she left 104 | The Rolling Stones | Sticky Fingers | 1971 [Chorus] I'd never walk Cornelia Street again Dear reader, if it feels like a trap It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here We called it off again last night, but Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love [Chorus] Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up 107.

To go for things that you want. It may seem incredibly scary at the moment but I would much rather do something and find that I hate it than wonder what if I had done the thing that scared me. Life is wildly different than one can ever imagine if you just really are not afraid to try Still sitting in a corner I haunt I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made You haven't met the new me yet It hits different this time He did it His fingers in it, and dry'd them on the boys head.

Many figures; and now 'tis Aries: He that's born under that sign has
Much cattle, much wooll, and to that a jolt-head, a brazen-face, and
Will be certainly a cuckold: There are many scholars, advocates, and
Horned beasts, come into the world under this sign. We praised our
Nativity-caster's pleasantness, and he went on then again: The whole
Heaven is Taurus, and wonder it e'er bore foot-ball-players
Herds-men, and such as can shift for themselves. Under Gemini are
Foaled coach-horses, oxen calved, great baubles, and such as can claw
Both sides are born. I was born my self under Cancer, and therefore
Stand on many feet, as having large possessions both by sea and land
For Cancer suits one as well as the other, and therefore I put nothing
Upon him, that I might not press my own geniture. Under Leo
Spendthrifts and bullies: under Virgo, women, runagates, and such as
Wear iron garters: under Libra, butchers, slipslop-makers, and men of
Business: under Scorpio, empoisoners and cut-throats: under Sagittary
Such as are goggle-ey'd, herb-women, and bacon-stealers: under
Capricorn, poor helpless rascals, to whom yet Nature intended horns to
Defend themselves: under Aquarius, cooks and paunch-bellies: under
Pisces, caterers and orators: And so the world goes round like a mill
And is never without its mischief; that men be either born or perish
But for that tuft of herbs in the middle, and the honey-comb upon it
I do nothing without just reason for it: Our mother the earth is in
The middle, made round like an egg, and has all good things in her
Self, like a honeycomb. I say, "Can you believe it?" Can I go where you go?
