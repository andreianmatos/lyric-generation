Harness, that they were no more to be broken than gold and silver
Ones: It so happened, that having made a drinking-pot, with a wide
Mouth of that kind, but the finest glass, fit for no man, as he
Thought, less than CÃ¦sar himself; he went with his present to
CÃ¦sar, and had admittance: The kind of the gift was praised, the
Hand of the workman commended, and the design of the giver accepted
He again, that he might turn the admiration of the beholders into
Astonishment, and work himself the more into the Emperor's favour
Pray'd the glass out of the Emperor's hand; and having received it
Threw it with such a force against the paved floor, that the most
Solid and firmest metal could not but have received some hurt thereby
CÃ¦sar also was no less amazed at it, than concerned for it; but the
Other took up the pot from the ground, not broken but bulg'd a little;
As if the substance of metal had put on the likeness of a glass; and
Therewith taking a hammer out of his pocket, he hammer'd it as it had
Been a brass kettle, and beat out the bruise: And now the fellow
Thought himself in Heaven, in having, as he fansied, gotten the
Acquaintance of CÃ¦sar, and the admiration of all: But it fell out
Quite contrary: CÃ¦sar asking him if any one knew how to make this
Malleable glass but himself? And he answering, there was not, the
Emperor commanded his head to be struck off: 'For,' said he, 'if this
Art were once known, gold and silver will be of no more esteem than
Dirt.'

And for silver, I more than ordinarily affect it: I have several Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes (Ooh, hoo, hoo) Nor had he sooner said it, than the fourth consort struck up; at which [Pre-Chorus] The rust that grew between telephones [Chorus] You were more than just a short time You might also like[Outro] Consideration the things of this world were done.

And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew When I was yet a long-hair'd boy, for even then I liv'd a pleasant
Life, I had a minion, and he dy'd: He was (so help me Hercules) a
Pearl, a paragon, nay perfection it self: But when the poor mother
Lamented him, and we also were doing the same, some witches got round
The house on a sudden, you'd have taken them for hounds hunting a
Hare. We had then in the house a Cappadocian, a tall fellow, stout
And hardy, that would not have stept an inch out of his way for
Jupiter. He boldly drew his sword, and wrapping his coat about his
Left arm, leaped out of the house, and as it might be here, (no hurt
To the thing I touch) ran a woman clean through. We heard a pitiful
Groan, but not to lye, saw none of them. Our champion came in and
Threw himself on a bed, but all black and blue, so he had been trosh'd
With flails; for it seems some ill hand had touched him. We shut the
Door, and went on with our mourning; but the mother taking her son in
Her arms, and stroaking him, found nothing but a bolster of straw; it
Had neither heart, entrals, nor any thing, for the fairies belike had
Stollen him out of his cradle, and left that of straw instead of him
Give me credit, I beseech ye, women are craftier than we are, play
Their tricks by night, and turn every thing topsy-turvy. After this
Our tall fellow never came to his colour again, but in a few days died
Raving-mad.

O the Saturnals! Why
How now, sirrah! is it the month of December? When were you twenty, I
Pray? What would this collop dropt from the gibbet, this crows-meat
Be at? I'll find some or other way for Jupiter to plague thee, and
Him that bred thee no better, or never let me eat a good meals-meat
Again: I could, sirrah, but for the companies sake, I spare thee; tho'
Either we understand not aright, or they are sots themselves that
Carry no better a hand over thee; for without doubt it is true, like
Master like man. I am hot by nature, and can scarce contain my self;
Give me but a mess of peaseporridge, and I care not two-pence for my
Mother. Very well, I shall meet thee abroad, thou mouse; nay, rather
Mole-hill. May I never thrive more, but I'll drive that master of
Thine into a blade of rue; nor shalt thou (so help me Hercules) 'scape
Me, tho' thou couldst call in Jupiter to thy aid: I shall off with
Those locks, and take thee when that trifling master of thine shall be
Out of the way; thou wilt certainly fall into my hands, and either I
Know not my self, or I'll make thee leave that buffoonry: Tho' thy
Beard were of gold, I'll have thee bruised in a mortar, and him that
First taught thee: I never studied geometry, criticism, and meer words
Without sence, but I understand the fitting of stones for buildings;
Can run you over a hundred things, as to metal, weight, coin, and that
To a tittle; if you have a mind you and I will try it between us: I'll
Lay thee a wager, thou wizard, and tho' I am wholly ignorant of
Rhetorick, thou'lt presently see thou hast lost: Let no one run about
The bush to me; I come up to him: Resolve me, I say, 'which of us
Runs, yet stirs not out of his place: which of us grows bigger, and
Yet is less.' Do you scamper? Can't you tell what to make of it, that
You look so like a mouse in a trap? Therefore either hold thy tongue
Or don't provoke a better man than thy self, who does not think thee
Fram'd of nature, unless thou fansiest me taken with those yellow
Curl'd locks, which thou hast already vowed to some whore or other. O
Lucky opportunity! Come, let's walk the exchange, and see which of us
Can take up money: You'll be satisfied then, this iron has credit
Upon't; a pretty thing, is it not! a drunken fox. So may I gain while
I live, and die well; but the people will brain me if I follow not
That coat on thy back, which is not for thy wearing, where-ever thou
Goest: He's a precious tool too, whoever he were, that taught thee; a
Piece of green cheese, no master. I have learn'd as well as another
Man, and my master said it would be my own another day. Save your
Worship! get home as fast as you can, but look well about you, and
Have a care how you speak irreverently of your betters, or vie estates
With them; he that does it, his purse shall feel it: For my self, that

To mastery in so fire an art aspire
Must all extreams first diligently shun
And in a settled course of vertue run
Let him not fortune with stiff greatness climb
Nor, courtier-like, with cringes undermine:
Nor all the brother blockheads of the pot
Ever persuade him to become a sot;
Nor flatter poets to acquire the fame
Of, I protest, a pretty gentleman
But whether in the war he wou'd be great
Or, in the gentler arts that rule a state;
Or, else his amorous breast he wou'd improve
Well to receive the youthful cares of love
In his first years to poetry inclin'd
Let Homer's spring bedew his fruitful mind;
His manlier years to manlier studies brought
Philosophy must next imply his thought
Then let his boundless soul new glories fire
And to the great Demosthenes aspire
When round in throngs the list'ning people come
T'admire what sprung in Greece so slow at home
Rais'd to this height, your leisure hours engage
In something just and worthy of the stage;
Your choice of words from Cicero derive
And in your poems you design shou'd live
The joys of feasts, and terrors of a war
More pleasing those, and these more frightful are
When told by you, than in their acting were:
And thus, enrich'd with such a golden store
You're truly fit to be an orator. Forever and ever, ah I regret you all the time I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover The Other World, the Skies Above (Shynron) [Outro] 286.

Guess I'm feeling unmoored I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did Everybody wants you Then for Trimalchio, he has more lands than a crow can fly over;
Monies upon monies: There lies more silver in his porters lodge, than
Any one man's whole estate. And for his family, hey-day, hey-day
There is not (so help me Hercules) one tenth of them that know their
Master. In brief, there is not one of those fools about him, but he
Can turn him into a cabbage-stalk. Nor is there any occasion to buy
Any thing, he has all at his own door; wooll, marte, pepper, nay hens
Milk; do but beat about and you'll find it. In a word, time was, his
Wooll was none of the best, and therefore he bought rams at Tarentum
To mend this breed; an in like manner he did by his honey, by bringing
His bees from Athens. It is not long since but he sent to the Indies
For mushroom-seed: Nor has he so much as a mule that did not come of a
Wild ass. See you all these quilts? there is not one of them whose
Wadding is not the finest comb'd wooll of violet or scarlet colour
Dy'd in grain. O happy man! but have a care how you put a slight on
Those freed men, they are rich rogues: See you him that sits at the
Lower-end of the table, he has now the Lord knows what; and 'tis not
Long since he was not worth a groat, and carried billets and faggots
At his back; it is said, but I know nothing of it myself, but as I
Have heard, either he got in with an old hog-grubbler, or had to do
With an incubus, and found a treasure: For my part, I envy no man, (if
God gives anything it is a bit of a blow, and wills no evil to himself
) he lately set up this proclamation:

Well was he once? I do not upbraid him: He was once worth a hundred
Thousand sesterstias, but has not now a hair of his head that is not
Engaged; nor, so help me Hercules, is it his own fault: There is not a
Better humour'd man than himself; but those rascally freed-men have
Cheated him of all: For know, when the pot boyls, and a man's estate
Declines, farewell friends. And what trade do you think he drove? He
Had the setting forth of grave men's funerals; and with that eat like
A prince: He had his wild boars served up covered; pastry-meats
Fowl-cooks, bakers: More wine was thrown under his table than most men
Have in their cellars; a meer phantasm: And when his estate was going
And he feared his creditors might fall upon him, he made an auction
